# App Icon Instructions

## How to add your custom app icon:

1. **Prepare your icon image:**
   - Create a square image (1024x1024 pixels recommended)
   - Use PNG format with transparent background (recommended)
   - Keep the design simple and recognizable at small sizes
   - Avoid text unless it's large and clear

2. **Add your icon:**
   - Save your icon as `app_icon.png`
   - Place it in this directory: `assets/icons/app_icon.png`

3. **Generate the icons:**
   - Run: `flutter pub get`
   - Run: `flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons`

## Current Status:
- ✅ flutter_launcher_icons package configured
- ✅ Directory structure created
- ⏳ Waiting for your app_icon.png file
- ⏳ Ready to generate platform-specific icons

## Next Steps:
1. Add your `app_icon.png` file to this directory
2. Run the generation commands above
3. Test your app on different platforms

Your app will then have custom icons on Android, iOS, Web, Windows, and macOS!
